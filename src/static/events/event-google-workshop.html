    <div>Flutter + Firebase - Build beautiful native apps in record time<br><br> We start by introducing Flutter, an open-source mobile application development SDK created by Google, as well as Firebase, a mobile and web application development platform.
      We then walk through an existing codelab, [https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase).
      
      Participants are welcome to follow along - they would need to install Flutter and get the starter app up and running as a pre-requisite (a Google account is required for using Firebase).</div>
