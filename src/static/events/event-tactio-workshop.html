      Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging standard describing API for exchanging electronic health records. 
      The standard, created by the HL7 organization, is one of the most promising standards in the industry these days. 
      Recently Tactio added FHIR support to its platform, opening a completely new array of possibilities for developers to create patient-centered Apps that take advantage in the latest technologies in remote patient monitoring and digital care plan.
      In the workshop, Tactio engineers will teach you how to bootstrap your mobile health App development using our API and a unique set of anonymized fake patient data. 
      The team will also introduce you to the Tactio Bluetooth lib that give you out-of-the-box access to hundreds of wireless IOT integrations like Garmin Vivofit, A&D blood pressure monitor and Nonin pulse oximeter.
