    <div>The next generation of Multisigs: building with the Gnosis Safe <br><br> The main way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain today is with externally owned accounts - a single private key which allows you to interact with all decentralized applications. However losing access to your private key means that you lose access your funds with no way to recover. The Gnosis Safe is a smart contract based wallet which allows you to add 2-Factor Authentication to your transactions and provides additional ways to recover access to your funds! Since it is a smart contract you have access to features like paying transactions costs with tokens instead of Ether and bundling multiple transactions into one! We provide mobile applications for Android and iOS and a Chrome Extension for extra security!</div>
