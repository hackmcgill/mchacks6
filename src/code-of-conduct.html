    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>McHacks aims to be a hackathon where all attendees and volunteers feel welcome, included, respected and safe.
      All attendees–including sponsors, students, speakers, judges, volunteers, and organizers–are therefore required
      to abide by the following code of conduct at all times.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual
      orientation, ability, physical appearance, race, or religion.</p>

    <p>We do not tolerate harassment in any form from attendees. Sexual language and inappropriate imagery is not
      appropriate for submitted projects or at any time or place during the event, including talks, workshops,
      receptions, and online media. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event
      without travel reimbursement at the discretion of the event organizers. Any events that violate the McHacks Code
      of Conduct should be reported as specified in the procedures at the end of the document.</p>

    <p>Additionally, attendees are expected to comply with the <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">Major
        League Hacking (MLH) code of conduct at all times.</a></p>

    <h2>Full Version</h2>

    <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual
      orientation, ability, physical appearance, race, religion; sexual or graphic images in public spaces; deliberate
      intimidation; stalking, following, harassing; photography or video recording someone without their consent;
      sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
    <p>Attendees exhibiting any of these harmful behaviours will be asked to stop immediately. Sponsors, speakers,
      volunteers and organizers are also expected to follow the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should
      not use sexualized images, activities, or other graphic materials. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not
      use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
    <p>In addition, hacks or projects submitted by teams that violate this code may be disqualified or denied the right
      to demo at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>
    <p>Photography is encouraged, but attendees must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed.
      If they object to being photographed, please comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs
      in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, for example in bathrooms or when attendees are
      sleeping.</p>
    <p>If a attendees engages in harmful behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
      including warning the perpetrator or expelling them from the event with no reimbursement.</p>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow
      the reporting procedures at the bottom of this document and report the incident immediately. Hackathon staff will
      be clearly identified and the Co-Directors can be reached at all times via the phone numbers below. </p>
    <p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help attendees contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide
      escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value
      your attendance and expect attendees to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and all related
      social events.</p>
    <h2>Reporting Procedures</h2>
