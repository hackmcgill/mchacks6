        <h1>Liability Waiver and Photo Release</h1>
        <p>Henceforth, all first person pronouns will refer to either to the McHacks participant or, if the participant
            is a minor (under 18 years of age), the legal parent or guardian of a minor speaking on behalf of said
            minor.</p>
        <p>I wish to participate in the McHacks software and hardware development contest. I hereby agree to comply
            with all of the McHacks rules and procedures and to act in accordance with the instructions of McHacks
            officials. I understand that, should I violate any of the aforementioned guidelines, I will be subject to
            the consequences deemed appropriate by the McHacks officials. Such consequences may involve the revocation
            of prizes and/or ejection from the hackathon.</p>
        <p>I verify that I have represented myself accurately on my application and in any subsequent information
            provided for McHacks officials. I understand that I may create the concept for my project or the project of
            my team (“My Project”) before I arrive at the contest, but that all development on My Project will take
            place on the McGIll University campus between 7:00 AM EST on Saturday, February 2rd, 2019 and 7:00 PM EST
            on Sunday, February 3th, 2019, unless stated otherwise by a McHacks official.</p>
        <p>I understand that McHacks will not claim ownership on My Project, but I hereby represent and warrant that
            all of the work on My Project is original to me or to my team and was produced during the event. That said,
            I also understand that my team can use publicly available code to produce My Project, as long as the
            license on that code allows such use and would allow My Project to be produced and marketed in commerce
            without further payment or restriction. I agree to allow McHacks officials or judges to view code from My
            Project for the purpose of judging and that the ruling of the judges is final. McHacks has no ownership
            interest in My Project and therefore has no liability for any legal or contractual issues that arise from
            My Project. I hereby agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend McHacks and McGill University against any
            liability related to My Project.</p>
        <p>McHacks, HackMcGill, the Students’ Society of McGill University, and McGill University are not liable for
            any emotional or physical damage to me, as well as physical damage to my computer, other equipment, and
            personal items, including the case of theft of my belongings. However, I am liable for any damage I may
            cause to McHacks or McGill University property. Food is provided by outside vendors and McHacks is not
            responsible for meeting any food­ related standards. McHacks, HackMcGill, the Students’ Society of McGill
            University, and McGill University are not liable for any consequential, punitive, secondary, speculative,
            special or incidental damages, and have no liability in any case and under any theory of action, even if
            they had been advised of the likelihood of such damages occurring.</p>
        <p>I hereby grant McHacks permission to use my photo or video image and the demo of My Project freely for any
            purpose, and I specifically grant permission to use these images or demo in marketing for McHacks.</p>
        <p>I acknowledge that I am responsible for respecting humankind and the hacking community at large by
            conducting myself in a manner deemed appropriate by the McHacks officials and not being abusive to other
            individuals during the event.</p>
